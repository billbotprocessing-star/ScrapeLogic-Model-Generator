# ScrapeLogic-Model-Generator

**ScrapeLogic** is an automated engine designed to turn any website URL into a validated monetization plan, offer stack, and launch roadmap in under 30 minutes.

It bridges the gap between "live web data" and "actionable business artifacts" for operators, marketers, and investors.
