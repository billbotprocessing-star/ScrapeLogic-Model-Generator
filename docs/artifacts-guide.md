# ScrapeLogic Artifacts Guide

This document defines the strategic logic and scoring criteria for the five core artifacts generated by the ScrapeLogic engine.

---

## 1. Positioning & Value Prop
**Engine:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet
**Logic:** This artifact performs a "Semantic Audit" of the source URL. It identifies not just what the company *says* they do, but the underlying category they occupy.
* **Target:** Identifies the "Ideal Customer Profile" (ICP).
* **The "Onlyness" Factor:** Claude identifies the one thing the competitor does that cannot be easily replicated.

## 2. Monetization Matrix
**Engine:** GPT-5.2
**Logic:** Generates three distinct revenue models (Subscription, Usage-based, Service-led).
* **Viability Score (1-10):** A proprietary calculation based on market friction vs. margin potential.
* **Value:** Provides an "Opportunity Map" for operators to pivot or expand revenue streams.

## 3. Competitive Gap Analysis
**Engine:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet
**Logic:** Maps the "Under-monetized" areas of the target URL. 
* **Analysis:** Claude looks for "Feature-Value Gaps"—features the company provides for free that could be packaged as a premium "Core" or "Pro" offering.

## 4. The Offer Stack
**Engine:** GPT-5.2
**Logic:** Translates the positioning into a high-conversion 3-tier pricing model.
* **Entry:** Low-friction/High-value lead magnet.
* **Core:** The main scalable product.
* **Premium:** High-ticket, manual, or high-touch fulfillment.

## 5. Launch Roadmap
**Engine:** GPT-5.2
**Logic:** A tactical execution plan.
* **Logic Stack Recommendations:** Specific tool suggestions (like n8n, Stripe, or specific CRMs) to fulfill the new offer stack.
* **The First Script:** A "Cold-to-Closed" outreach template designed to be sent to the first 10 prospects immediately.
